# Overlook Hotel

## Introduction
  - For this project, I built a hotel management site using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Mocha and Chai were utilized as well to test all classes. This project also works with data stored in a local api server. 
  - This project was a great mix of solidifying my understanding of all technologies used, and my love for and past experience in interior design (I spent far too long researching luxury hotel rooms to use for all of my imagery).  
  - Customers can login, view past and upcoming bookings, search for available hotel rooms per date, and book new rooms.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Atom
  - Mocha / Chai
  - Webpack


## Goals, Challenges, and Wins
### Goals
- Incoporating Fetch calls and interaction with a backend API.
- Determine what classes to set up and what methods to put in each, test all classes.
- Access and manipulate data through array methods to display correct information on the webpage. 

### Challenges
- Problem solving to break complex goals into manageable steps.
- Create and set up classes to effectively manage data. After setting up my initial classes, I was having issues with my methods not pulling in the data correctly. I created a new Hotel class which allowed me to write methods to create new bookings, view available rooms, and determine total costs.

### Wins
- I sharpened my CSS skills and am proud of the way my webpage looks.
- My JavaScript functions are organized in a way that intuitively follows a users journey throughout the page.
- I was able to complete the majority of this project on my own but still collaborated with my classmates to see different problem solving strategies.

## Possible Future Extensions
  - Ability to book multiple dates at a time.
  - Ability for a user to search through existing bookings and filter them.
